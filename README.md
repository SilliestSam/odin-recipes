This is exciting, but I'm still a little nervous. This is a public repository that I'm showing to the world and I know how scared I am of people viewing my work. This is less a show of my html skills (which I should be very competent in once I finish this project) and more of a test to see if I don't run away from a challenge that other people are going to see.

    <h1>Fancy Grilled Cheese</h1>
    <img src="./images/fancy-grilled-cheese.jpeg">
    <p>Grilled cheese is a classic American dish, acceptable for any time of the day, and very easy to make.
       Despite it's ease, you can make it as simple or as complex as you want. Adding ingredients, changing cook times,
       and making your own perfect cut are all fair game.
    </p>
    <p>The grilled cheese sandwich gained major popularity during the great depression, where cheap and affordable meals
        were a must. It's often served with tomato soup, another food item that's really easy to get your hands on and serve.
        This recipe will be a bit more complex: pesto and tomato to show how versatile the classic grilled cheese can really
        be.
